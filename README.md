# FizBuzz
Code Louisville Python programming exercise

## Overview

> Fizz buzz (often spelled FizzBuzz in this context) has been used as an interview screening device for computer programmers. Writing a program to output the first 100 FizzBuzz numbers is a relatively trivial problem requiring little more than a loop and conditional statements. However, its value in coding interviews is to analyze fundamental coding habits that may be indicative of overall coding ingenuity.

From [FizzBuzz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fizz_buzz) on wikipedia.org.

In this exercise we will implement the classic programming challenge FizzBuzz. This is the Week 2 Bonus Exercise from the openSAP Learn Python course.If you have already solved it as part of the Learn Python course you can re-use your code here.

Write a Python program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. If the number is dividable by 3 print Fizz, if the number is dividable by 5 print Buzz instead of the number. If the number is dividable by 3 and 5 print FizzBuzz instead of the number.

Below is the output of the program for the first 15 numbers:

```
1
2
Fizz
4
Buzz
Fizz
7
8
Fizz
Buzz
11
Fizz
13
14
FizzBuzz
```
